# Founders
This is the complete project for the CloudCoin Founders Edition for Console Based Powning.
This software was written so the original founders of the CloudCoin Consortium could 
manage their CloudCoins. There is nothing fancy about it. 

Features:
1. Fits on a USB drive
2. Does not use encryption
3. Slow but fault tolerant to protect from coin loss.

This is written using Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition in the C# lanaguage.

These classes have been converted to Javascript and PHP. There are more primitive versions in Java and Android Java.
